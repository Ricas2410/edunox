I am an IT personel, I have searched and discovered uopeople. I want to take it upon myself and advertise or broadcast to people from afar. I want to move to villages and others and help people who did not get the oportunity to get access. Some are not computer literate so I will have to apply for them and even the scholarship. since Tuition is free and that's is the dream of the institution, I wanna ask if I can charge the people with a little fee for transportation and DATA BUNDLE and other services. some people too IO need to explain things and let them know how they can learn online `
