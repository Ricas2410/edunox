## üìß Email Authentication Setup

### For Production (Recommended)

1. **SPF Record** - Add to your DNS:
   ```
   v=spf1 include:zoho.com ~all
   ```

2. **DKIM** - Enable in Zoho Mail settings:
   - Go to Zoho Mail Admin Console
   - Navigate to Email Authentication
   - Enable DKIM for your domain

3. **DMARC** - Add to your DNS:
   ```
   v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:dmarc@deigratiams.edu.gh
   ```

### For Development

- Use a dedicated development email address
- Consider using email testing services like Mailtrap
- Monitor spam scores with tools like Mail Tester

## üéØ Best Practices for Email Deliverability

### 1. Sender Reputation
- Use consistent "From" email address
- Ensure "From" email matches authenticated domain
- Avoid frequent changes to sender information

### 2. Content Guidelines
- Maintain good text-to-image ratio
- Avoid spam trigger words
- Include clear unsubscribe options
- Use proper HTML structure

### 3. Technical Setup
- Enable TLS encryption
- Use proper SMTP authentication
- Monitor bounce rates
- Implement proper error handling

## üß™ Testing Email Delivery

### 1. Test Email Configuration
```bash
# In Django shell
python manage.py shell

from core.email_utils import send_html_email
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

user = User.objects.first()
result = send_html_email(
    subject='Test Email',
    template_name='welcome',
    context={'user': user},
    recipient_list=['your-email@example.com']
)
print(f"Email sent: {result}")
```

### 2. Check Spam Score
- Use tools like Mail Tester (mail-tester.com)
- Send test emails to different providers
- Monitor delivery rates

### 3. Monitor Email Logs
- Check Django logs for email errors
- Monitor SMTP server logs
- Track bounce and complaint rates

## üîç Troubleshooting
